      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

            <div style="font-size: 16px" >Currently, 30% of all food ends up as food waste and 25% of areas are considered food deserts throughout
              the United States. To combat this problem, we decided to create Food Oasis. Food Oasis color codes all the
              US counties based on their VLFS (Very Low Food Security) level, and connects existing farms, biofuel facilities,
              and food pantries within county limits. The short distance between the farms and biofuel facilities and food
              pantries incentivizes farmers to give back their surplus to their communities. We plan to transport blemished
              and decomposing goods using third-party shipping companies by asking them to make a "pit stop" to transport the
              goods along their already established route.</div>
